exception : exception is a one kind of event which disturb the normal flow of the program.

exception handling : to handle this kind of exception its called exception handling

there is a best way to handle exception there is keyword like try and except

Key Components:

try block: Contains the code that might raise an exception.
except block: Contains code to handle the exception if one occurs.
else block (optional): Contains code to execute if no exception is raised.
finally block (optional): Contains code that always executes, regardless of whether an exception was raised.

Error : 

Errors in Python are issues in the code that prevent the program from executing as expected.Errors 
can be broadly classified into two categories:

(1) Syntax Errors:

These occur when Python cannot understand the code due to incorrect syntax.
Detected at compile time (before execution).

(2) Exceptions:

These occur during runtime and indicate that something went wrong while the code was running.

Examples of exceptions include:

ZeroDivisionError: Division by zero.
ValueError: Invalid input type.
FileNotFoundError: File not found.
IndexError: Accessing an out-of-range index in a list.
