(85) When will the else part of try-except-else be executed ?

what is else part ?

    1. If the try block runs successfully without raising an exception, the else block will execute.

    2. If an exception occurs in the try block, the else block is skipped, and the appropriate except block (if available) is executed.

Why we Use the else part ?

    The else block is typically used for code that should run only when the try block succeeds,
    keeping it separate from the code that handles exceptions.

Syntax :

    try:
        result = 10 / 2
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Division by zero is not allowed.")
    else:
        print(f"Division successful, result is {result}.")
