How will you compare two lists ?

1. Using == Operator (Equality Comparison):

    The == operator compares two lists element by element to check if they have the same elements in the same order.

    Example:
    list1 = [1, 2, 3]
    list2 = [1, 2, 3]
    list3 = [3, 2, 1]

    print(list1 == list2)  # True: Both lists have the same elements in the same order
    print(list1 == list3)  # False: Elements are the same, but the order is different

    Output:
    True
    False

2. Using != Operator (Inequality Comparison):

    The != operator checks if two lists are not equal.

    Example:
    list1 = [1, 2, 3]
    list2 = [1, 2, 3]
    list3 = [3, 2, 1]

    print(list1 != list2)  # False: Lists are equal
    print(list1 != list3)  # True: Lists are not equal

    Output:
    False
    True

3. Using sorted() to Compare Unordered Lists:

    If you want to compare two lists regardless of the order of the elements, you can sort them first and then compare.

    Example:
    list1 = [1, 2, 3]
    list2 = [3, 2, 1]

    print(sorted(list1) == sorted(list2))  # True: Both lists have the same elements, order doesn't matter

    Output:
    True

4. Using set() to Compare Lists (Ignoring Order and Duplicates):

    You can convert the lists to sets, which will automatically ignore order and duplicate elements, and then compare them.

    Example:
    list1 = [1, 2, 3]
    list2 = [3, 2, 1]
    list3 = [1, 2, 2, 3]

    print(set(list1) == set(list2))  # True: Order doesn't matter
    print(set(list1) == set(list3))  # True: Duplicate elements are ignored

    Output:
    True
    True

5. Using List Comprehension to Compare Element by Element:

    If you need to compare lists element by element and identify differences, you can use list comprehension.

    Example:
    list1 = [1, 2, 3]
    list2 = [1, 2, 4]

    differences = [i for i in range(len(list1)) if list1[i] != list2[i]]
    print(differences)  # Output will show the index where the lists differ

    Output:

    [2]  # List1 and List2 differ at index 2

6. Using all() with a Loop:

    You can use a combination of all() and a loop to check whether all corresponding elements in two lists are equal.

    Example:
    list1 = [1, 2, 3]
    list2 = [1, 2, 3]

    are_equal = all(a == b for a, b in zip(list1, list2))
    print(are_equal)  # True if all elements are the same in the same order

    Output:
    True
